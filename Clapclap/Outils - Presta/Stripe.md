### Please explain which products or services you plan to sell through Stripe
We are building a marketplace of goods from local providers, but all the orders are issued as group buys allowing groups of friends, relatives or colleagues to buy together their favorite products at a discounted price. The business model is very simple : it is free for end consumers, only the providers pays a subscription fee for being listed on our platform and we charge 5% fee on every group buy reaching a minimum amount sold.
We are based in France and will only address the french market to start with.


### Provide details around products/inventory, pricing, shipping details, and customer-vetting processes, if applicable.
Right now we have ~20 providers on the platform selling chocolate, soap, infusions & teas, wine, beer...
We intend to grow the number of providers fairly quickly to cover the whole country.
"Group buy" implies reaching a minimum amount sold for the provider to offer discounted prices, therefore should this minimum not be reached at the end of the group buy period, we refund all the participants who already took part to this group buy session.
