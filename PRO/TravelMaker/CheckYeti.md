- @Mauricio
  - strategic opex
- travelgate
  - no "activities" right now
- what is Travelgate
  - dedicated to integration
  - others : booking engines, websites, backoffices ...
    - BUT only a little of connectivity
  - travelgate : connectivity ONLY
    - clients handles their bookings themselves
    - hotel content, photos etc...
      - not actively sold
- Globic (@Xavi)
  - BCN based
  - similar but for activities
  - inspired by Travelgate
- Checkity
  - CEO @ Checkity
  - ecommerce founding partners 20 years ago
  - Munich based
  - Invertor but not happy
  - found checkity and found the good opportunity
    - 10 years of activity
  - Winter activities
    - less unique for summer activities
    - focus on outdoor nature
  - CEO & invest (founders = CFO & COO)
  - Reservation with Globic?
  - Partner w/ Travelsoft
    - bank?
- Travelgate 2012 -> sold for Travelsoft 2024
  - to start with : any kind of API
    - hotel, activities, ferries, flights, car rental, transfers
  - 2019 : full focus on accomadation
  - post sold
    - 1000 connections to accomadation
    - thinking to broaden to other markets
    - reason why it did not work
      - accomadation is the main product
      - the rest no.. but the industry is not ready yet
      - the margin is on accomadation hence the focus on this vertical
    - today it could be different, the market has changed
  - travelgate : is just connecting 
    - standardization of the APIs
    - using the credentials of the customers to connect to suppliers
    - fee based on the total volume generated (~0.5%)
      - the B2B margin is very low not allowing more to us
- Right now 
- Checkity :
  - interested in knowing how much 
  - not the operator, but OTA (Online Travel Agency)
  - 3500 providers
  - shared responsability
  - onboarding, update prices, content...
  - Winter : market leader by far
    - low margin, low tech adoption
    - tools : SEO ranking
  - Summer : 
    - higher tech adoption rate
    - 2019 a lot of demand
- San Diego

- ATOL = mafia insurance https://www.atol.org/
	- UK only
	- insurrance for travel agencis
	- to get the licence to sell packages
- IATA https://www.iata.org/
	- to be able to sell flights
	- every airlines BUT low cost
		- in theory OTA cannot sell low cost (as they are NOT part of IATA)
		- Ryanair - captcha to protect against scrapping
